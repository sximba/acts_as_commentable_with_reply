= Acts As Commentable with Reply

Provides a single Comment model that can be attached to any model(s) within your app. It creates
Comment and CommentReply models and handles the plumbing between those models and any models that you declare to be
commentable models.


== Installation :

Add the following line to your Gemfile

=== Rails 4

  gem 'acts_as_commentable'

== Generator


=== Rails 4

  rails g comment

Then migrate your database to add the comments and comment_replies models:

  rake db:migrate

== Usage

Make the desired ActiveRecord model act as commentable:
 
  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_commentable
  end

Add a comment to a model instance by adding the following to the controller:
 
  commentable = Post.create
  comment = commentable.comments.create
  comment.title = "First comment."
  comment.comment = "This is the first comment."
  comment.save

Add a reply to a comment instance by adding the following to the controller:

  comment = Comment.find x # Any other way of obtaining a comment instance
  reply = comment.comment_replies.create :reply => "This is the first reply."

Fetch comments for the commentable model by adding the following to the view:
 
  commentable = Post.find(1)
  comments = commentable.comments.recent.limit(10).all

Fetch replies for a comment instance by adding the following to the controller/view:

  comment = Comment.find x # Any other way of obtaining a comment instance
  replies = CommentReply.find_comment_replies comment

You can also add different types of comments to a model:
 
  class Todo < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_commentable :public, :private
  end

To fetch the different types of comments for this model:

  public_comments = Todo.find(1).public_comments
  private_comments = Todo.find(1).private_comments


By default, `acts_as_commentable` will assume you are using a `Comment` model.
To change this, or change any other join options, pass in an options hash:

    class Todo < ActiveRecord::Base
      acts_as_commentable class_name: 'MyComment'
    end

This also works in conjunction with comment types:

    class Todo < ActiveRecord::Base
      acts_as_commentable :public, :private, { class_name: 'MyComment' }
    end
